## 🔍 Context for AI Assistant

When you start a new chat, tell the AI:

> "I'm working on the LX4T Content Platform. Check PROJECT-PLAN.md and CONTINUE-DEVELOPMENT.md for context. Show me the TODO list and let me know where we left off."

## 📊 Phase Overview

- **Phase 1:** Core Platform (2-3 weeks) - 8 tasks
- **Phase 2:** Creator Tools (2 weeks) - 6 tasks  
- **Phase 3:** Communities (1-2 weeks) - 5 tasks
- **Phase 4:** AI Features (1 week) - 5 tasks

**Total:** 24 tasks across 6-8 weeks

## 🎨 Design Notes

### Keep Consistent:

## 🚨 Important Reminders

1. **Don't break existing features** - Video player and watch parties must keep working
2. **Test incrementally** - Each feature should work before moving on
3. **Commit frequently** - Push to git after each completed task
4. **Update this file** - Keep progress notes current
5. **Mark TODOs** - Update task status as you go
