## 🟣 NOW DEPLOY TO HEROKU (5 Minutes!)

### STEP 1: Install Heroku CLI

**Download from**: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli

**OR use this direct link**:
- Windows 64-bit: https://cli-assets.heroku.com/heroku-x64.exe
- Windows 32-bit: https://cli-assets.heroku.com/heroku-x86.exe

1. Download the installer
2. Run it
3. Close and reopen PowerShell/Terminal

---

### STEP 2: Login to Heroku

```bash
heroku login
```

This opens your browser - login with:
- Email + Password
- OR GitHub account
- OR Google account

---

### STEP 3: Create Heroku App

```bash
# Try these names (pick one that's available):
heroku create lx4t-player

# If taken, try:
heroku create lx4t-video
# OR
heroku create movienight-lx4t
# OR
heroku create lx4t-watch-party
# OR just let Heroku generate a random name:
heroku create
```

---

### STEP 4: Deploy to Heroku

```bash
git push heroku main
```

Wait 1-2 minutes while Heroku:
- Installs dependencies
- Builds your app
- Starts the server

You'll see:
```
remote: -----> Build succeeded!
remote: -----> Launching...
remote:        https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com deployed to Heroku
```

---

### STEP 5: Open Your Live App!

```bash
heroku open
```

**Your app is now LIVE on the internet!** 🌍🎉

---

### STEP 6: Update Socket URL (IMPORTANT!)

After deploying, you'll get a URL like:
```
https://lx4t-player.herokuapp.com
```

**You MUST update this in your code:**

1. Open `script.js`
2. Find line ~311 (search for `SOCKET_URL`)
3. Change:
   ```javascript
   const SOCKET_URL = 'http://localhost:3001';
   ```
   To:
   ```javascript
   const SOCKET_URL = 'https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com';
   ```

4. Save and push:
   ```bash
   git add script.js
   git commit -m "Update Socket URL for production"
   git push heroku main
   git push origin main
   ```

---

### STEP 7: Test Multiplayer!

1. Open your Heroku URL on your computer
2. Open same URL on your phone (or different browser)
3. Create a party on one device
4. Join on the other device
5. Play video on one - watch it sync on the other!
6. **IT WORKS!** 🎬🎉

---

## 🎯 ALTERNATIVE: Use Railway (Even Easier!)

If Heroku seems complicated, use **Railway.app** instead:

1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Click "Login with GitHub"
3. Click "New Project"
4. Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
5. Select: `FlappyJack212/lx4t-video-player`
6. Click "Deploy Now"
7. **DONE!** Railway handles everything!

Railway gives you a URL like:
```
https://lx4t-video-player.up.railway.app
```

Update `SOCKET_URL` to this URL and you're live!
